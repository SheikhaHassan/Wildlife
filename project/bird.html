        <div class="centered" style="font-size: 25px; top: 66%;">What to do if you find a baby bird</div>
    </div>
    <p> </p>
    <h2 class="mainPoint"> Should you help a baby bird? </h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> Parents will not abandon baby birds because they have been touched by humans. In most cases, a baby bird should be left alone; wildlife rescue organisations take in thousands of baby birds yearly, which while being well-intentioned rescue efforts are often more damaging than helpful. This page will help advise you on whether you should try to help a baby bird, what to do, and who to contact if you come across one. The Wildlife Trusts do not offer a general service for care and rehabilitation of wildlife, although some individual Trusts may offer local services. Before intervening, ask yourself the following questions:</p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <h2 class="question"> Does it have feathers? </h2>
    <p> No feathers: It’s a nestling. Nestlings are very fragile and need immediate attention as they won't survive outside the nest for long. They should be (gently!) put back in the nest if you can see it, and the parents should return shortly. If you can’t see the nest, or if the parents do not return to the nest within an hour, contact a local wildlife rescue group.

        Partially feathered: Birds that are still fluffy with short tails aren't as vulnerable, but will still be relying on their parents for food. It is likely their parents aren't far away
        
        If it has feathers: It's a fledgling. It is normal for a fledgling to spend a few days on the ground and should be left alone unless they are in immediate danger. Its parents are normally keeping an eye nearby so you may want to watch and see if you can spot the parents, bearing in mind that they may be kept away by your presence.</p>

    <p>
        
    </p>
    <h2 class="question"> Is it hurt or in immediate danger? </h2>
    <p> It is a myth that its parents won't come back to a baby bird if it has been touched by a human. If you see a baby bird in a vulnerable position, you can move it to a safe, sheltered spot nearby e.g. under a hedge or onto a low branch if it is a fledgling, or back into its nest if it is a nestling. If it is in your garden, keep pets like cats and dogs indoors if possible, and if you are concerned about other garden visitors, you can keep a watch out from your window. 

        If it is obviously hurt, you may try to catch it and contact a local wildlife rescue organisation or vet. The younger it is and the fewer feathers it has, the sooner it will need expert attention. Birds bitten by cats are at risk of septicaemia (blood poisoning) and will die without swift antibiotic treatment within the first few hours. Contact a vet as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2 class="mainPoint"> Handling and care </h2>
    <p>
        Rushing in to save every lone baby bird you come across isn't recommended, and survival rates are low, but sometimes intervention can save a life. Having answered the questions above, if you have decided to intervene, here are some things to consider in preparing to catch, handle and care for the bird while you seek expert advice. Take care!
    </p>
<p> Baby birds should be handled very gently and will usually be more comfortable with their wings held against their bodies, feet supported. If possible, prepare the following before you attempt to rescue the bird:</p>
<ul style="font-family: cursive;">
<li> Prepare a container for the bird before catching it if possible - something like an ice cream tub or a shoebox lined with tissues will usually be ok Remember to provide air holes if you need to cover the box </li>
Put the bird somewhere quiet and warm - a nestling should be warm to the touch, but not hot or panting
<li>Prepare a water bottle wrapped in a towel as a source of heat placed next to, under, or inside the box, with space for the bird to move away if it wants to</li>
<li> Do not offer food or water, or try to hand rear the bird unless you have directly been instructed to do so by an expert. They have very specialised diets and it is very easy to drown a bird by trying to give it water.</li>
</ul>
